3
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:54,121
<i>Tansy!</i>

4
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:56,991
Tansy! Tansy!

5
00:01:57,025 --> 00:02:00,127
Tansy!

6
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:18,913
Tansy!

7
00:02:18,947 --> 00:02:20,981
There you are.

8
00:02:25,153 --> 00:02:27,354
I can't see her, Ramsay.

9
00:02:30,792 --> 00:02:32,426
Tansy!

10
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:38,265
If you make it out
of the woods, you win!

11
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,768
Run, Tansy, run!

12
00:02:49,311 --> 00:02:52,279
<i>- Tansy.</i>
<i>- Where is she?</i>

13
00:02:52,314 --> 00:02:55,549
<i>Tansy, Tansy, Tansy!</i>

14
00:03:16,338 --> 00:03:19,073
Good girls.
Down, girls.

15
00:03:19,107 --> 00:03:20,975
Down.

16
00:03:21,009 --> 00:03:23,210
Well done.
You, too.

17
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:25,946
- I only wounded her.
- You brought her down. That's what matters.

18
00:03:25,981 --> 00:03:28,682
A fine shot.
Wasn't it, Reek?

19
00:03:28,717 --> 00:03:30,884
A fine shot, master.
My lady.

20
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,153
Please, my lord.
It hurts.

21
00:03:33,188 --> 00:03:35,789
Oh, sweet.
Don't cry.

22
00:03:35,824 --> 00:03:38,125
It will be over soon.

23
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:42,029
She thinks
she's pretty.

24
00:03:42,063 --> 00:03:43,564
Let me put one
through her face.

25
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,165
We have to reward
the hounds, love.

26
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,034
They did all
the hard work.

27
00:03:47,068 --> 00:03:49,570
Why? I did
whatever you asked.

28
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,338
But you made Myranda
feel jealous.

29
00:03:51,373 --> 00:03:54,275
- Me jealous of her?
- <i>My lord, please.</i>

30
00:03:54,309 --> 00:03:57,511
You can see that your presence
has become a bit of a problem.

31
00:03:59,547 --> 00:04:01,548
Rip her!
Rip her!

32
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,617
Rip her!

33
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:08,622
Not so pretty now.

34
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:24,038
<i>Your new hand, it's nicer</i>
<i>than the old one.</i>

35
00:04:24,072 --> 00:04:25,372
Wouldn't you agree, Pod?

36
00:04:25,407 --> 00:04:27,474
Is it solid gold?

37
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:30,511
Gilded steel.
You're not eating.

38
00:04:30,545 --> 00:04:32,446
Why is no one eating?

39
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,249
My wife wastes away
and my brother starves himself.

40
00:04:35,283 --> 00:04:37,318
- I'm not hungry.
- You lost a hand,

41
00:04:37,352 --> 00:04:39,620
not a stomach.

42
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,455
Try the boar.

43
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:44,491
Cersei can't get enough
of it since one killed Robert for her.

44
00:04:45,894 --> 00:04:47,761
A toast.

45
00:04:47,796 --> 00:04:51,165
To the proud
Lannister children.

46
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,068
The dwarf, the cripple,
and the mother of madness.

47
00:04:54,102 --> 00:04:55,736
- Oh!
- I'll clean it up.

48
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,771
No, I'll do it.
Leave us.

49
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:02,910
It's only wine.

50
00:05:11,986 --> 00:05:13,954
I can't fight anymore.

51
00:05:13,988 --> 00:05:15,656
What about your left?

52
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:20,494
I can hold a sword,
but all my instincts are wrong.

53
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,596
How can I
protect the king

54
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,331
when I can hardly
wipe my own ass?

55
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,967
You're the Lord Commander now.
Command.

56
00:05:27,001 --> 00:05:29,903
Let others
do the fighting.

57
00:05:29,938 --> 00:05:33,107
When was the last time
Father used a sword?

58
00:05:33,141 --> 00:05:35,542
I'm not Father.
I'm the Kingslayer.

59
00:05:35,577 --> 00:05:37,711
When people find out
I can't slay a pigeon...

60
00:05:37,746 --> 00:05:40,981
Train, then.
Learn to fight with your other hand.

61
00:05:41,015 --> 00:05:44,385
With whom? You?
Men talk.

62
00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:46,954
Soon as someone discovers I can't fight,
he'll tell everyone.

63
00:05:49,524 --> 00:05:52,526
You need a proper,
discreet swordsman.

64
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,196
As it happens,
I have just the one.

65
00:06:04,939 --> 00:06:08,008
My brother tells me
you can keep your mouth shut.

66
00:06:08,042 --> 00:06:09,977
Unusual talent
for a sellsword.

67
00:06:10,011 --> 00:06:12,179
He tells me
you shit gold

68
00:06:12,213 --> 00:06:15,048
just like your father.

69
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,950
Is this place safe?

70
00:06:19,187 --> 00:06:21,488
There's this knight,
Leygood,

71
00:06:21,523 --> 00:06:24,124
- got thunderbolts on his shield.
- Uh-huh.

72
00:06:24,159 --> 00:06:26,660
Right here is where
I fuck his wife.

73
00:06:26,694 --> 00:06:28,996
She's a screamer,
that one.

74
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,765
If they don't hear her,
they won't hear us.

75
00:06:33,368 --> 00:06:36,003
I've never seen
Valyrian steel before.

76
00:06:36,037 --> 00:06:38,405
She's a beauty.
The problem is,

77
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,774
if you fight with
an edged blade,

78
00:06:40,809 --> 00:06:42,976
I'll have to.

79
00:06:43,011 --> 00:06:44,445
And if I fight with
an edged blade,

80
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,914
I'll have no one
left to pay me.

81
00:06:48,683 --> 00:06:51,051
I haven't used a sparring
sword since I was nine.

82
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,591
Ah!

83
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,928
Bold warrior you are,
attacking a man when his guard's down.

84
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:03,263
Best time
to attack a man.

85
00:07:05,233 --> 00:07:07,301
Mind yourself.

86
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,705
- If I still had my right hand...
- Plan on growing it back?

87
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,121
Come on, then.

88
00:07:39,434 --> 00:07:41,335
<i>Open the gates!</i>

89
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:45,272
<i>Riders coming in!</i>

90
00:08:00,955 --> 00:08:03,757
<i>Let's get these</i>
<i>horses seen to!</i>

91
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,228
Father.
Welcome home.

92
00:08:08,263 --> 00:08:12,366
Walda, this is
Ramsay Snow, my bastard.

93
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,468
A pleasure, Mother.

94
00:08:14,502 --> 00:08:16,537
Hello.

95
00:08:16,571 --> 00:08:19,239
<i>See that the horses are fed,</i>
<i>watered, and rubbed down.</i>

96
00:08:19,274 --> 00:08:22,576
And take Lady Walda
to her chambers.

97
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:24,645
This way, my lady.

98
00:08:24,679 --> 00:08:26,747
Where is your prize?

99
00:08:26,781 --> 00:08:28,382
With the hounds.

100
00:08:29,751 --> 00:08:32,019
I'll have a look at him.

101
00:08:37,425 --> 00:08:39,660
I hear you took a hand
from the Kingslayer.

102
00:08:39,694 --> 00:08:42,462
Word travels.
How he screamed.

103
00:08:42,497 --> 00:08:44,998
You would have loved it.

104
00:08:54,309 --> 00:08:56,143
Father.

105
00:09:04,652 --> 00:09:06,453
What did you
do to him?

106
00:09:06,487 --> 00:09:10,791
I trained him. He was a slow learner,
but he learned.

107
00:09:10,825 --> 00:09:13,460
You flayed him.

108
00:09:13,494 --> 00:09:15,862
Peeled a few bits.

109
00:09:15,897 --> 00:09:17,831
Removed a few others.

110
00:09:20,368 --> 00:09:22,736
This was Balon Greyjoy's
son and heir.

111
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,172
We've been flaying
our enemies for 1,000 years.

112
00:09:25,206 --> 00:09:27,274
The flayed man
is on our banners.

113
00:09:27,308 --> 00:09:29,142
My banners,
not yours.

114
00:09:29,177 --> 00:09:31,178
You're not a Bolton.
You're a Snow.

115
00:09:34,882 --> 00:09:37,384
Tywin Lannister has given
me the North.

116
00:09:37,418 --> 00:09:39,920
But he won't lift a finger
to help me take it.

117
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,822
As long as the ironborn
hold Moat Cailin,

118
00:09:41,856 --> 00:09:44,057
<i>our armies are trapped</i>
<i>south of the Neck.</i>

119
00:09:44,092 --> 00:09:47,361
Theon was a valuable hostage,
not your plaything.

120
00:09:47,395 --> 00:09:50,831
I wanted to trade him
for Moat Cailin.

121
00:09:50,865 --> 00:09:52,666
I already asked.

122
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:56,169
Lord Greyjoy refused.
Savages have no--

123
00:09:56,204 --> 00:09:59,206
You sent terms to Balon Greyjoy
without my consent?

124
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,308
You made me acting
Lord of the Dreadfort.

125
00:10:01,342 --> 00:10:02,809
I acted.

126
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:11,451
I had to smuggle myself
into my own lands

127
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:13,286
thanks to the Greyjoys.

128
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,288
I needed Theon.

129
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,257
I needed him whole.

130
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:20,761
Theon was our enemy.

131
00:10:20,795 --> 00:10:22,796
But Reek,

132
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,666
Reek will never
betray us.

133
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:29,403
I placed far too much
trust in you.

134
00:10:38,212 --> 00:10:42,082
Reek, how could you let me stand
before my father unshaven?

135
00:10:42,116 --> 00:10:45,585
- <i>It's disrespectful.</i>
- I'm sorry, my lord.

136
00:10:47,789 --> 00:10:49,890
Give him the razor.

137
00:10:57,732 --> 00:11:01,001
If I'm not a Bolton,
Father, what does it matter?

138
00:11:09,143 --> 00:11:10,677
Go on, Reek.

139
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:13,146
<i>A nice close shave.</i>

140
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:36,870
Reek, tell Father

141
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:39,940
where are Bran
and Rickon Stark?

142
00:11:39,974 --> 00:11:42,008
I don't know,
my lord.

143
00:11:42,043 --> 00:11:43,777
You murdered them

144
00:11:43,811 --> 00:11:47,581
and displayed their corpses
at Winterfell.

145
00:11:47,615 --> 00:11:51,051
<i>Reek,</i>

146
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:53,320
did you murder
the Stark boys?

147
00:11:53,354 --> 00:11:55,522
No, my lord.

148
00:11:55,556 --> 00:11:56,823
Just two farm boys.

149
00:11:56,858 --> 00:11:59,826
<i>And crisped them</i>
<i>so no one would know.</i>

150
00:11:59,861 --> 00:12:02,496
<i>Yes, my lord.</i>

151
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:07,000
The Starks have always
ruled the North.

152
00:12:07,034 --> 00:12:09,703
If Bran and Rickon
are alive,

153
00:12:09,737 --> 00:12:12,305
the country will rally
to their side

154
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,541
now that
Robb Stark is gone.

155
00:12:16,711 --> 00:12:19,579
<i>Oh, that's right, Reek.</i>

156
00:12:21,015 --> 00:12:23,049
Robb Stark is dead.

157
00:12:23,084 --> 00:12:25,819
<i>Sorry.</i>

158
00:12:25,853 --> 00:12:28,121
<i>I know he was like</i>
<i>a brother to you.</i>

159
00:12:28,156 --> 00:12:31,091
But my father put a knife
through his heart.

160
00:12:34,395 --> 00:12:36,530
How do you feel
about that?

161
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:52,412
- You ready for a hunt?
- Always.

162
00:12:52,446 --> 00:12:55,682
Find those boys and I'll give you
1,000 acres and a holdfast.

163
00:12:55,716 --> 00:12:57,751
Your pet rat
have any thoughts

164
00:12:57,785 --> 00:12:59,986
on which way they went
after Winterfell?

165
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:04,157
Jon Snow is at
Castle Black.

166
00:13:05,593 --> 00:13:07,527
Who the fuck
is Jon Snow?

167
00:13:07,562 --> 00:13:08,929
Their bastard brother.

168
00:13:08,963 --> 00:13:11,231
He could be
sheltering them.

169
00:13:11,265 --> 00:13:12,833
He may know
where they are.

170
00:13:14,468 --> 00:13:17,938
Even if he doesn't,
he's half Stark himself.

171
00:13:17,972 --> 00:13:19,606
Could be a threat.

172
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,775
You want to prove
yourself a Bolton?

173
00:13:21,809 --> 00:13:25,378
Gather whatever
men you can and ride for Moat Cailin.

174
00:13:25,413 --> 00:13:27,647
Bring this creature
of yours.

175
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,984
Maybe he'll be
of some use.

176
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,422
Take the Moat
for the family,

177
00:13:35,456 --> 00:13:37,123
for <i>our</i> family,

178
00:13:37,158 --> 00:13:39,659
and I'll reconsider
your position.

179
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:46,199
Lord Varys.
Breakfasting with the king?

180
00:13:46,234 --> 00:13:49,502
I'm afraid foreigners aren't
welcome at such exclusive affairs.

181
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:52,339
- Oh, to be foreign.
- Ahem.

182
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,507
Shae has been noticed.

183
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,009
Sansa's maid
saw you with her.

184
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:57,744
She already told
your sister.

185
00:13:57,812 --> 00:14:00,013
It's only a matter of time
before your father hears.

186
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:03,216
So I'm guilty of being seen with
my own wife's handmaiden.

187
00:14:03,251 --> 00:14:05,018
My father will ask you
if there's anything more

188
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,720
and you'll tell him
some clever lie.

189
00:14:06,754 --> 00:14:08,455
No, I will not.

190
00:14:08,489 --> 00:14:11,758
How long do you imagine
your father and sister would let me live

191
00:14:11,792 --> 00:14:14,127
if they suspected
me of lying?

192
00:14:14,161 --> 00:14:16,563
I have no pet sellsword
to protect me.

193
00:14:16,597 --> 00:14:18,632
No legendary brother
to avenge me.

194
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:21,101
<i>Only little birds</i>
<i>who whisper in my ear.</i>

195
00:14:21,135 --> 00:14:22,903
Forgive me
if I don't weep for you.

196
00:14:22,937 --> 00:14:25,972
No one weeps
for spiders or whores.

197
00:14:26,007 --> 00:14:29,142
I have friends across
the sea who could help her.

198
00:14:29,176 --> 00:14:30,677
She won't leave.

199
00:14:30,711 --> 00:14:31,978
I've told her this is
a dangerous place

200
00:14:32,013 --> 00:14:33,914
so many times,
she no longer believes it.

201
00:14:33,948 --> 00:14:36,917
Your father has promised
to hang the next whore he finds you with.

202
00:14:36,951 --> 00:14:40,487
Have you ever known
your father to make an idle threat?

203
00:14:43,524 --> 00:14:45,692
From House Tyrell
and the people of the Reach,

204
00:14:45,726 --> 00:14:49,930
Your Grace, it is my honor to present you
with this wedding cup.

205
00:14:49,964 --> 00:14:52,499
May you
and my daughter Margaery

206
00:14:52,533 --> 00:14:54,334
drink deep
and live long.

207
00:14:54,368 --> 00:14:56,770
A handsome goblet,
my lord.

208
00:14:56,804 --> 00:14:59,439
Or shall I call
you Father?

209
00:14:59,473 --> 00:15:02,008
I shall be honored,
Your Grace.

210
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:11,751
She's the whore
I told you about.

211
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:13,586
The dark-haired one.

212
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:18,258
Have her brought to the Tower of the Hand
before the wedding.

213
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:30,103
A book?

214
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:32,572
"The Lives of Four Kings."
Grand Maester Kaeth's history

215
00:15:32,606 --> 00:15:34,908
of the reigns of
Daeron the Young Dragon,

216
00:15:34,942 --> 00:15:39,412
Baelor the Blessed, Aegon the Unworthy,
and Daeron the Good.

217
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,147
A book every king
should read.

218
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,325
Now that the war is won,

219
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,528
we should all find
time for wisdom.

220
00:15:56,597 --> 00:15:58,798
Thank you, Uncle.

221
00:16:10,444 --> 00:16:13,079
One of only two Valyrian
steel swords in the capital,

222
00:16:13,114 --> 00:16:17,017
Your Grace, freshly
forged in your honor.

223
00:16:29,797 --> 00:16:33,833
Careful, Your Grace.
Nothing cuts like Valyrian steel.

224
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:36,136
So they say.

225
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,749
Such a great sword
should have a name.

226
00:16:49,784 --> 00:16:52,585
- What shall I call her?
<i>- Stormbringer.</i>

227
00:16:52,686 --> 00:16:54,754
<i>- Terminus.</i>
<i>- Widow's Wail.</i>

228
00:16:54,789 --> 00:16:57,290
<i>- Wolfsbane.</i>
- Widow's Wail. I like that.

229
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,694
Every time I use it,
it'll be like cutting off

230
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,363
Ned Stark's head
all over again.

231
00:17:31,826 --> 00:17:33,626
Don't.

232
00:17:35,663 --> 00:17:37,697
You want me on the desk?

233
00:17:39,834 --> 00:17:43,369
- <i>What's wrong, my lion?</i>
- Don't call me that.

234
00:17:43,404 --> 00:17:46,106
What should I call you?

235
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:49,075
I'm afraid our friendship
can't continue.

236
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,877
Our friendship?

237
00:17:50,911 --> 00:17:53,279
There's a ship waiting in
the harbor bound for Pentos.

238
00:17:54,348 --> 00:17:55,515
What?

239
00:17:55,549 --> 00:17:56,983
You'll have your own
cabin, of course,

240
00:17:57,017 --> 00:18:01,387
and across the Narrow Sea
a house, servants.

241
00:18:02,656 --> 00:18:04,090
What is this?

242
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,326
I'm a married man.

243
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,229
My wife has suffered a great deal,
as you well know.

244
00:18:09,263 --> 00:18:12,398
<i>I don't want her to suffer anymore</i>
<i>on my account.</i>

245
00:18:12,433 --> 00:18:14,601
I need to uphold my vows.

246
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:17,270
She doesn't want you.

247
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,939
- <i>I need to do right by her.</i>
- You don't want her.

248
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:21,674
By our children.

249
00:18:23,944 --> 00:18:26,045
- What are you afraid of?
- I'm not afraid.

250
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,482
You are. You are afraid of
your father and your sister.

251
00:18:29,517 --> 00:18:32,198
- You're going to run from them all your life?
- I need you to leave.

252
00:18:32,219 --> 00:18:35,221
I'm not afraid of them.
I'm not going to run.

253
00:18:35,256 --> 00:18:37,590
- Shae.
- We will fight them together.

254
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:39,993
It's like you said,
I am yours and you are mine.

255
00:18:40,027 --> 00:18:42,128
You're a whore!

256
00:18:44,465 --> 00:18:47,367
Sansa is fit to bear
my children and you are not.

257
00:18:47,401 --> 00:18:49,869
I can't be in love
with a whore.

258
00:18:49,904 --> 00:18:52,305
I can't have children
with a whore.

259
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:55,041
How many men
have you been with?

260
00:18:55,075 --> 00:18:57,310
500? 5,000?

261
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:05,618
How many whores
have you been with?

262
00:19:05,653 --> 00:19:07,787
I have enjoyed my time
with all of them

263
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,923
and I have enjoyed my time
with you most of all.

264
00:19:09,957 --> 00:19:12,258
But now that time
is over.

265
00:19:28,008 --> 00:19:31,244
You'll have a comfortable
life in Pentos.

266
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:36,115
Bronn will escort you
to your ship.

267
00:20:01,542 --> 00:20:04,077
Hear us now.

268
00:20:04,111 --> 00:20:06,679
Accept these tokens
of our faith, my lord,

269
00:20:06,714 --> 00:20:08,648
and lead us
from the darkness.

270
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:12,919
Sire, I served you well.

271
00:20:12,953 --> 00:20:15,888
<i>Lord of Light, show us the way...</i>

272
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:20,326
Selyse, you're my sister!

273
00:20:20,361 --> 00:20:21,894
Yours are the stars
that guide us.

274
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,530
Tell him!
Tell him!

275
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,534
<i>for the night is dark</i>
<i>and full of terrors.</i>

276
00:20:40,681 --> 00:20:43,149
Did you see?
Their souls.

277
00:20:43,183 --> 00:20:45,618
It was their souls.

278
00:20:45,653 --> 00:20:48,688
Our lord took them.
Did you see?

279
00:20:55,262 --> 00:20:58,264
Lord Florent was
your brother by law.

280
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:00,566
He was an infidel.

281
00:21:00,601 --> 00:21:03,069
He worshipped the gods
of his fathers

282
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:05,271
and their fathers
before him.

283
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:07,940
They were the gods
of your fathers, too.

284
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:10,276
I ordered him to tear
down his idols.

285
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:11,744
He disobeyed.

286
00:21:11,779 --> 00:21:14,080
How many ships did he
bring to your cause?

287
00:21:14,114 --> 00:21:15,381
How many men?

288
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:17,784
A good deal
more than you.

289
00:21:19,219 --> 00:21:21,054
Did you see,
Ser Davos?

290
00:21:21,088 --> 00:21:22,388
They're with
our lord now.

291
00:21:22,423 --> 00:21:24,957
Their sins all burned away.
Did you see?

292
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:27,660
I'm sure they're more
than grateful, my queen.

293
00:21:41,942 --> 00:21:43,676
Meat's off.

294
00:21:45,045 --> 00:21:47,413
Our larders
are almost empty.

295
00:21:47,448 --> 00:21:49,482
Serve fish, then.
We're on an island.

296
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:51,084
You hate fish.

297
00:21:51,118 --> 00:21:53,920
I hate a good many things,
but I suffer them all the same.

298
00:21:55,456 --> 00:21:59,325
When Storm's End
was under siege and I was starving,

299
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,463
<i>Stannis boiled soup</i>
<i>for me from books.</i>

300
00:22:03,497 --> 00:22:06,566
The binding glue
is made from horses.

301
00:22:09,503 --> 00:22:14,140
One morning, he shot two seagulls
on the beach.

302
00:22:14,174 --> 00:22:17,844
I've never tasted anything
as good as grilled seagull.

303
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:21,614
- Do you remember?
- Of course I remember.

304
00:22:24,284 --> 00:22:26,853
Have you ever known
true hunger, my lady?

305
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:29,088
<i>It's all I knew</i>
<i>when I was a child</i>

306
00:22:29,123 --> 00:22:31,290
Until you found
the Lord of Light?

307
00:22:31,325 --> 00:22:33,860
Until he found me.

308
00:22:40,768 --> 00:22:43,002
I fear for
our daughter's soul.

309
00:22:44,705 --> 00:22:46,572
<i>Every mother should fear</i>
<i>for her child's soul.</i>

310
00:22:46,607 --> 00:22:48,741
- She's a stubborn little beast.
- She's a child.

311
00:22:48,776 --> 00:22:50,877
You barely know her.

312
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:53,780
You think she's sweet
because she smiles when you visit.

313
00:22:53,814 --> 00:22:56,082
She's sullen and stubborn
and sinful.

314
00:22:56,116 --> 00:22:59,152
Why else would the Lord of Light have
seen fit to mark her face?

315
00:22:59,186 --> 00:23:00,686
She needs the rod.

316
00:23:00,721 --> 00:23:04,190
She's my daughter.
You will not strike her.

317
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:07,260
As you command.

318
00:23:09,329 --> 00:23:11,731
Perhaps the Lady Melisandre
could speak with her.

319
00:23:19,506 --> 00:23:21,140
Come in.

320
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,611
Were you sleeping,
Princess?

321
00:23:30,217 --> 00:23:32,585
Did you watch the ceremony
on the beach?

322
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:35,021
I heard it.

323
00:23:35,055 --> 00:23:36,656
And it frightened you?

324
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:38,558
Ser Axel was my uncle.

325
00:23:38,592 --> 00:23:40,860
<i>He was always</i>
<i>kind to me.</i>

326
00:23:40,894 --> 00:23:42,862
They're in a better
place now, Princess.

327
00:23:42,896 --> 00:23:45,731
<i>The fire cleansed them</i>
<i>of the sins of the world.</i>

328
00:23:45,766 --> 00:23:47,366
But they screamed.

329
00:23:47,401 --> 00:23:49,402
Women scream
when they give birth.

330
00:23:49,436 --> 00:23:52,038
Afterward they are
filled with joy.

331
00:23:52,072 --> 00:23:53,739
Afterward they aren't
ash and bone.

332
00:23:53,774 --> 00:23:55,775
You have so many
questions, don't you?

333
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:58,010
<i>So did I</i>
<i>when I was a child.</i>

334
00:23:58,045 --> 00:24:00,379
I was much like you.

335
00:24:00,414 --> 00:24:03,015
Only I wasn't a princess.

336
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:04,617
And you didn't have this.

337
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:06,519
No.

338
00:24:06,553 --> 00:24:09,455
But I suffered in other ways,
sweet girl, believe me.

339
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:11,891
What do you know
of the gods?

340
00:24:11,925 --> 00:24:14,193
I read
"The Seven-Pointed Star."

341
00:24:14,228 --> 00:24:16,996
Lies and fables.

342
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:20,066
Septons speak
of seven gods.

343
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,667
There are but two--

344
00:24:21,702 --> 00:24:24,070
a god of light
and love and joy

345
00:24:24,104 --> 00:24:27,740
and a god of darkness,
evil, and fear.

346
00:24:27,774 --> 00:24:29,509
Eternally at war.

347
00:24:29,543 --> 00:24:33,546
There are no seven heavens
and no seven hells?

348
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:37,316
There's only one hell,
Princess.

349
00:24:37,351 --> 00:24:40,520
The one we live in now.

350
00:25:14,788 --> 00:25:17,723
<i>Hodor.</i>

351
00:25:21,795 --> 00:25:23,029
Why did you wake me?

352
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:25,998
You've been gone
for hours.

353
00:25:26,033 --> 00:25:27,667
I was hungry.

354
00:25:27,701 --> 00:25:29,769
We're all hungry.

355
00:25:29,803 --> 00:25:31,504
I was just eating.

356
00:25:31,538 --> 00:25:34,574
Summer was eating.

357
00:25:34,641 --> 00:25:37,577
Your body can't live on
the food your wolf consumes.

358
00:25:37,611 --> 00:25:40,746
<i>Spending too much time</i>
<i>in Summer's skin is dangerous.</i>

359
00:25:42,316 --> 00:25:44,116
You're not
a direwolf, Bran.

360
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,055
Must be glorious, though.

361
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:52,758
To run, to leap,
to hunt.

362
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:55,761
To be whole.

363
00:25:55,796 --> 00:25:58,564
<i>I know that's tempting,</i>

364
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:00,866
but if you're trapped
in Summer for too long,

365
00:26:00,901 --> 00:26:02,768
you'll forget what it was
to be human.

366
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,874
You'd forget us, Bran.

367
00:26:08,909 --> 00:26:10,810
You'd forget your mother
and father.

368
00:26:10,844 --> 00:26:12,845
You'd forget your brothers
and sisters.

369
00:26:12,879 --> 00:26:14,614
You'd forget Winterfell.

370
00:26:14,648 --> 00:26:16,549
You'd forget you.

371
00:26:16,583 --> 00:26:20,720
And if we lose you,
we lose everything.

372
00:26:52,185 --> 00:26:55,421
Hodor, take me
to the tree.

373
00:27:43,637 --> 00:27:45,638
<i>Look for me...</i>

374
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:52,645
<i>...beneath the tree.</i>

375
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,818
<i>He saw us.</i>

376
00:28:02,923 --> 00:28:04,123
<i>North.</i>

377
00:28:13,533 --> 00:28:15,801
I know where
we have to go.

378
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:06,252
Let it be known
that Margaery of House Tyrell

379
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:10,156
<i>and Joffrey of the Houses</i>
<i>Lannister and Baratheon</i>

380
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:14,026
are one heart, one flesh,
one soul.

381
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:16,695
<i>Cursed be he</i>

382
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:19,965
<i>who would seek</i>
<i>to tear them asunder.</i>

383
00:29:22,035 --> 00:29:26,438
With this kiss,
I pledge my love.

384
00:29:47,794 --> 00:29:49,862
We have a new queen.

385
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:53,799
Better her than you.

386
00:30:05,979 --> 00:30:08,914
- Bit much, wouldn't you say?
- It feels proportionate.

387
00:30:08,949 --> 00:30:12,084
- Proportionate to what?
- The expected extravagance.

388
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:14,553
People who spend their money
on this sort of nonsense

389
00:30:14,588 --> 00:30:16,188
tend not to have it
for long.

390
00:30:16,223 --> 00:30:19,425
You ought to try
enjoying something before you die.

391
00:30:19,459 --> 00:30:21,026
You might find
it suits you.

392
00:30:21,061 --> 00:30:24,697
Not now, Mace.
Lord Tywin and I are speaking.

393
00:30:24,731 --> 00:30:27,166
Anyway, I don't know what
you're complaining about.

394
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,567
I'm paying my share.

395
00:30:28,602 --> 00:30:30,903
Shall we stick golden roses
in half the meat pies

396
00:30:30,937 --> 00:30:32,605
to commemorate
your generosity?

397
00:30:32,639 --> 00:30:36,108
No, your heartfelt
thank-you is its own reward.

398
00:30:36,142 --> 00:30:39,111
I would imagine I'd be hearing it
again before long.

399
00:30:39,145 --> 00:30:41,313
Wars are rather expensive.

400
00:30:41,348 --> 00:30:44,350
"The Iron Bank
will have its due."

401
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:47,119
How they love
to remind everyone.

402
00:30:47,153 --> 00:30:49,822
Almost as much as you
Lannisters with your debts.

403
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,824
I'm not worried about
the Iron Bank.

404
00:30:51,858 --> 00:30:54,426
We both know
you're smarter than that.

405
00:30:54,461 --> 00:30:58,564
Come, Tywin, let us
celebrate young love.

406
00:31:10,443 --> 00:31:12,278
All taken care of.

407
00:31:12,312 --> 00:31:15,247
- You saw her board the ship?
- Aye, she's on it.

408
00:31:15,282 --> 00:31:17,149
You saw the ship
sail away?

409
00:31:17,183 --> 00:31:20,819
No one knows she's there
but you, me, and Varys.

410
00:31:20,854 --> 00:31:22,755
How do you know?

411
00:31:22,789 --> 00:31:25,324
Because if someone follows
me without an invitation,

412
00:31:25,358 --> 00:31:27,092
I'm the last person
they ever follow.

413
00:31:27,127 --> 00:31:29,228
There's someone
following you?

414
00:31:30,997 --> 00:31:32,631
She's gone.

415
00:31:32,666 --> 00:31:35,000
I know you don't
want to believe it, but she is.

416
00:31:35,035 --> 00:31:38,370
Now, go drink till it
feels like you did the right thing.

417
00:31:44,411 --> 00:31:46,578
Hello.

418
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:49,114
- Hello.
- Not you.

419
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:07,399
You look
exquisite, child.

420
00:32:07,434 --> 00:32:10,736
The wind has been
at you, though.

421
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:13,872
I haven't had
the opportunity to tell you

422
00:32:13,907 --> 00:32:16,675
how sorry I was to hear
about your brother.

423
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:20,245
War is war, but killing a man
at a wedding,

424
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,847
horrid.

425
00:32:21,881 --> 00:32:24,116
What sort of monster
would do such a thing?

426
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:27,619
As if men need more
reasons to fear marriage.

427
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:29,154
My lady.
My lady.

428
00:32:29,189 --> 00:32:32,458
Lord Tyrion, you see?
Not as bad as all that.

429
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:34,159
Perhaps if
your pauper husband

430
00:32:34,194 --> 00:32:36,729
were to sell his mule
and his last pair of shoes,

431
00:32:36,763 --> 00:32:40,065
he might be able to afford
to bring you to Highgarden for a visit.

432
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:43,135
Now that peace has come
and all is right with the world,

433
00:32:43,203 --> 00:32:45,237
it would do you good
to see some of it.

434
00:32:45,271 --> 00:32:48,240
You must excuse me.
It's time I ate

435
00:32:48,274 --> 00:32:50,376
some of this food
I paid for.

436
00:32:54,047 --> 00:32:56,915
♪ A coat of gold ♪

437
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:59,618
♪ Or a coat of red ♪

438
00:32:59,652 --> 00:33:05,524
<i>♪ A lion</i>
<i>still has claws ♪</i>

439
00:33:05,558 --> 00:33:07,993
♪ And mine,
my lord... ♪

440
00:33:08,028 --> 00:33:10,462
Very good. Very good.
Off you go.

441
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:29,915
My love, why don't we
make the announcement?

442
00:33:32,485 --> 00:33:34,053
Everyone.

443
00:33:34,087 --> 00:33:37,890
The queen would like
to say a few words.

444
00:33:45,432 --> 00:33:47,266
We are so fortunate

445
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,535
to enjoy this marvelous
food and drink.

446
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:52,071
Not all among us
are so lucky.

447
00:33:52,105 --> 00:33:56,041
To thank the gods for bringing
the recent war to a just end,

448
00:33:56,076 --> 00:33:59,378
King Joffrey has decreed
that the leftovers

449
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:03,115
from our feast be given
to the poorest in his city.

450
00:34:14,794 --> 00:34:17,029
You're an example
to us all.

451
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:35,280
Ser Jaime,
I'm very sorry.

452
00:34:35,315 --> 00:34:36,982
Ser Loras,
it's quite all right.

453
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:41,720
Your sister looks
very beautiful.

454
00:34:41,754 --> 00:34:43,288
<i>As does yours.</i>

455
00:34:43,323 --> 00:34:46,391
So, looking forward
to your wedding?

456
00:34:46,426 --> 00:34:48,760
Yes, very much.

457
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:51,163
Our fathers are both
rather keen on the prospect.

458
00:34:51,197 --> 00:34:52,698
They certainly are.

459
00:34:52,732 --> 00:34:53,999
Perhaps they should
get married.

460
00:34:56,202 --> 00:34:58,637
If you were
to marry Cersei,

461
00:34:58,671 --> 00:35:00,272
she'd murder you
in your sleep.

462
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:04,009
If you somehow managed
to put a child in her first,

463
00:35:04,043 --> 00:35:06,178
she'd murder him, too,

464
00:35:06,212 --> 00:35:07,913
long before he drew
his first breath.

465
00:35:07,947 --> 00:35:11,049
Luckily for you,
none of this will happen

466
00:35:11,084 --> 00:35:13,685
because you'll never
marry her.

467
00:35:16,556 --> 00:35:18,657
And neither will you.

468
00:35:32,205 --> 00:35:34,339
Your Grace.
My king.

469
00:35:34,374 --> 00:35:36,241
- My queen.
- Lady Brienne.

470
00:35:36,276 --> 00:35:38,544
So good of you to come.

471
00:35:38,578 --> 00:35:40,012
I'm no lady,
Your Grace.

472
00:35:40,046 --> 00:35:42,447
Did you just bow?

473
00:35:42,482 --> 00:35:43,949
Apologies, Your Grace.

474
00:35:43,983 --> 00:35:46,718
I never did master
the curtsy.

475
00:35:46,753 --> 00:35:48,353
You're the one who put a sword
through Renly Baratheon.

476
00:35:48,388 --> 00:35:51,356
That's not true, my love.
Brienne had nothing to do with it.

477
00:35:51,391 --> 00:35:53,091
A shame.

478
00:35:53,126 --> 00:35:55,761
I'd knight the man that put an end
to that deviant's life.

479
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:59,064
I just wanted
to congratulate you both

480
00:35:59,098 --> 00:36:00,465
and wish you good fortune.

481
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,401
The country has been
at war too long.

482
00:36:02,435 --> 00:36:05,671
I hope your reign
is long and peaceful.

483
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:07,506
- Yes, yes.
- Thank you.

484
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,741
I hope we see
more of you.

485
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:18,584
Lady Brienne.

486
00:36:18,618 --> 00:36:21,453
You're Lord Selwyn
Tarth's daughter.

487
00:36:21,487 --> 00:36:24,456
That makes you a lady
whether you want to be or not.

488
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:26,758
As you say, Your Grace.

489
00:36:26,793 --> 00:36:28,227
I owe you my gratitude.

490
00:36:28,261 --> 00:36:30,562
You returned my brother
safely to King's Landing.

491
00:36:33,032 --> 00:36:35,400
In truth, he rescued me,
Your Grace.

492
00:36:35,435 --> 00:36:37,169
More than once.

493
00:36:37,203 --> 00:36:39,304
Did he?

494
00:36:40,373 --> 00:36:41,974
Haven't heard
that story before.

495
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:46,178
Not such a fascinating
story, I'm afraid.

496
00:36:46,212 --> 00:36:48,580
I'm sure you have many
fascinating stories.

497
00:36:48,615 --> 00:36:52,718
Sworn to Renly Baratheon.
Sworn to Catelyn Stark. And now my brother.

498
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:56,255
Must be exciting to flit
from one camp to the next

499
00:36:56,289 --> 00:36:59,057
serving whichever lord
or lady you fancy.

500
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:01,627
I don't serve
your brother, Your Grace.

501
00:37:01,661 --> 00:37:03,795
But you love him.

502
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:13,772
Your Grace.

503
00:37:24,317 --> 00:37:28,353
No, no, come to my chambers
and I will examine you personally.

504
00:37:28,388 --> 00:37:30,656
- She'll do no such thing.
- Oh, Your Grace.

505
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:32,858
Yes, well, this young
lady sought my advice--

506
00:37:32,892 --> 00:37:34,593
You should see Qyburn.
He's quite good.

507
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:37,729
- Your Grace.
- Qyburn? Deplorable man.

508
00:37:37,764 --> 00:37:41,166
Brought shame on the Citadel with his
repugnant experiments.

509
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,535
More repugnant than
your gnarled fingers on that girl's thighs?

510
00:37:43,569 --> 00:37:45,937
Your Grace,
I am a man of learning.

511
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:48,774
My little brother had you sent to
the Black Cells when you annoyed him.

512
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:50,888
What do you think
I could do to you if you annoyed me?

513
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:52,878
I never meant
to annoy anyone.

514
00:37:52,912 --> 00:37:55,814
But you are.
You annoy me right now.

515
00:37:55,848 --> 00:37:58,016
Every breath you draw
in my presence annoys me.

516
00:37:58,051 --> 00:37:59,551
So here's what I want
you to do.

517
00:37:59,585 --> 00:38:01,119
I want you to leave
my presence.

518
00:38:01,154 --> 00:38:02,587
Leave this wedding
right now.

519
00:38:02,622 --> 00:38:04,256
Go to the kitchens
and instruct them

520
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:07,726
that all the leftovers from the feast
will be brought to the kennels.

521
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,995
Your Grace,
Queen Margaery--

522
00:38:10,029 --> 00:38:12,364
The <i>queen</i> is telling you

523
00:38:12,398 --> 00:38:14,666
the leftovers
will feed the dogs

524
00:38:14,701 --> 00:38:16,935
or you will.

525
00:38:35,722 --> 00:38:38,757
A gold dragon to whoever
knocks my fool's hat off.

526
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:52,571
You're in rather
a good mood.

527
00:38:52,605 --> 00:38:54,906
- I suppose I am.
- I won't ask why.

528
00:38:54,941 --> 00:38:58,143
- Small pleasures.
- Your Grace. Lord Tywin.

529
00:38:58,177 --> 00:38:59,711
Prince Oberyn.

530
00:38:59,746 --> 00:39:01,079
I don't believe you
have met Ellaria.

531
00:39:01,114 --> 00:39:02,848
This is the Lord Hand
Tywin Lannister

532
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:05,283
and Cersei Lannister
the Queen Regent.

533
00:39:05,318 --> 00:39:08,019
I suppose it is
former Queen Regent now.

534
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:11,456
Lord Hand
and Lady Cersei,

535
00:39:11,491 --> 00:39:15,527
- Ellaria Sand.
- My lord. My lady.

536
00:39:15,529 --> 00:39:17,262
Charmed.

537
00:39:17,296 --> 00:39:19,464
Can't say I've ever
met a Sand before.

538
00:39:23,336 --> 00:39:24,836
We are everywhere in Dorne.

539
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:27,205
I have 10,000 brothers
and sisters.

540
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,674
Bastards are born
of passion, aren't they?

541
00:39:29,709 --> 00:39:31,109
We don't despise them
in Dorne.

542
00:39:31,144 --> 00:39:32,344
No?
How tolerant of you.

543
00:39:32,378 --> 00:39:34,413
I expect it is a relief,
Lady Cersei,

544
00:39:34,447 --> 00:39:37,149
giving up your regal
responsibilities.

545
00:39:37,183 --> 00:39:40,318
Wearing the crown for so many years
must have left your neck a bit crooked.

546
00:39:40,353 --> 00:39:42,354
I suppose you'll never
know, Prince Oberyn.

547
00:39:42,388 --> 00:39:44,322
It's a shame your older brother couldn't
attend the wedding.

548
00:39:44,357 --> 00:39:46,691
Please give him
our regards.

549
00:39:46,726 --> 00:39:48,460
With any luck,
the gout will abate

550
00:39:48,494 --> 00:39:50,128
with time and he will
be able to walk again.

551
00:39:50,163 --> 00:39:52,063
They call it
the rich man's disease.

552
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:53,465
A wonder
you don't have it.

553
00:39:53,499 --> 00:39:55,367
Noblemen in my part
of the country

554
00:39:55,401 --> 00:39:58,470
don't enjoy the same lifestyle
as our counterparts in Dorne.

555
00:39:58,504 --> 00:40:00,372
People everywhere
have their differences.

556
00:40:00,406 --> 00:40:03,608
In some places the highborn
frown upon those of low birth.

557
00:40:03,643 --> 00:40:06,945
In other places the rape and murder
of women and children

558
00:40:06,979 --> 00:40:08,914
is considered distasteful.

559
00:40:10,883 --> 00:40:14,186
What a fortunate
thing for you, former Queen Regent,

560
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:16,188
that your daughter
Myrcella has been sent

561
00:40:16,222 --> 00:40:18,557
to live in the latter
sort of place.

562
00:40:21,894 --> 00:40:25,697
Everyone, silence!
Clear the floor.

563
00:40:28,067 --> 00:40:31,837
There's been too much
amusement here today.

564
00:40:31,871 --> 00:40:35,707
A royal wedding
is not an amusement.

565
00:40:35,741 --> 00:40:38,710
A royal wedding
is history.

566
00:40:38,744 --> 00:40:41,246
The time has come
for all of us

567
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,715
to contemplate
our history.

568
00:40:44,717 --> 00:40:46,084
My lords...

569
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:50,455
my ladies...

570
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:53,792
I give you

571
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:56,294
King Joffrey...

572
00:40:56,329 --> 00:40:58,797
<i>...Renly, Stannis,</i>

573
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:02,234
<i>Robb Stark,</i>
<i>Balon Greyjoy.</i>

574
00:41:02,268 --> 00:41:05,570
The War of the Five Kings.

575
00:41:08,941 --> 00:41:11,076
I'm the rightful king.

576
00:41:12,245 --> 00:41:15,046
- King in the North!
- Yes!

577
00:41:19,151 --> 00:41:22,153
<i>Traitor. You're a traitor.</i>

578
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:25,457
<i>For the Seven Kingdoms!</i>

579
00:41:29,228 --> 00:41:31,329
Let the war begin.

580
00:41:33,666 --> 00:41:36,368
Renly, you're no king.

581
00:41:36,402 --> 00:41:39,638
Away, degenerate.
Away. Away.

582
00:41:39,672 --> 00:41:42,307
Ooh, careful.

583
00:41:42,341 --> 00:41:44,843
- Go on.
- I want you to be my prince.

584
00:41:52,818 --> 00:41:54,352
Stannis!

585
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:56,821
Who's got the gold
now, Stark?

586
00:41:56,856 --> 00:42:00,191
I am the rightful king.
Challenge me, ruffian.

587
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:02,027
- Take that.
- I'm drowning. I'm drowning.

588
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:04,496
I am the King
in the North!

589
00:42:08,668 --> 00:42:10,669
Not wildfire!

590
00:42:18,144 --> 00:42:20,879
Pay each of them 20 gold
when this is done.

591
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:22,914
<i>Yes, my lord.</i>

592
00:42:22,949 --> 00:42:25,183
We'll have to find another
way to thank the king.

593
00:42:29,422 --> 00:42:31,356
Charge!

594
00:42:36,062 --> 00:42:38,563
Ready, again.

595
00:42:42,335 --> 00:42:44,169
I am the King
in the North!

596
00:42:45,972 --> 00:42:47,739
- Charge!
- Charge!

597
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:49,641
Yes!

598
00:42:49,675 --> 00:42:52,944
<i>Your head!</i>

599
00:43:27,446 --> 00:43:30,348
Fine gentlemen.

600
00:43:38,624 --> 00:43:41,092
Well fought.
Well fought.

601
00:43:41,127 --> 00:43:44,029
Here you are.
Champion's purse.

602
00:43:45,297 --> 00:43:49,601
Though you're not
the champion yet, are you?

603
00:43:49,635 --> 00:43:53,238
A true champion defeats
all the challengers.

604
00:43:53,272 --> 00:43:55,640
Surely there are
others out there

605
00:43:55,675 --> 00:43:58,276
who still dare
to challenge my reign.

606
00:43:58,310 --> 00:44:00,378
Uncle.

607
00:44:00,413 --> 00:44:03,648
How about you?
I'm sure they have a spare costume.

608
00:44:09,689 --> 00:44:12,757
One taste of combat was
enough for me, Your Grace.

609
00:44:12,792 --> 00:44:15,393
I would like to keep
what remains of my face.

610
00:44:15,428 --> 00:44:17,862
<i>I think you</i>
<i>should fight him.</i>

611
00:44:17,897 --> 00:44:19,698
This was but
a poor imitation

612
00:44:19,732 --> 00:44:21,666
of your own bravery
on the field of battle.

613
00:44:21,701 --> 00:44:24,202
I speak
as a firsthand witness.

614
00:44:24,236 --> 00:44:26,271
<i>Climb down from</i>
<i>the high table</i>

615
00:44:26,305 --> 00:44:28,373
<i>with your new</i>
<i>Valyrian sword</i>

616
00:44:28,407 --> 00:44:31,576
and show everyone how
a true king wins his throne.

617
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:33,945
<i>Be careful, though.</i>

618
00:44:33,979 --> 00:44:37,015
This one is clearly
mad with lust.

619
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:40,919
It would be a tragedy
for the king to lose his virtue

620
00:44:40,953 --> 00:44:42,987
hours before
his wedding night.

621
00:45:13,686 --> 00:45:15,520
A fine vintage.

622
00:45:15,554 --> 00:45:17,288
Shame that it spilled.

623
00:45:17,323 --> 00:45:19,224
It did not spill.

624
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:21,526
My love,
come back to me.

625
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,328
It's time for
my father's toast.

626
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:27,932
Well, how does he expect me
to toast without wine?

627
00:45:30,002 --> 00:45:34,506
Uncle, you can be
my cupbearer

628
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:36,808
seeing as you're
too cowardly to fight.

629
00:45:36,842 --> 00:45:39,043
Your Grace does me
a great honor.

630
00:45:39,078 --> 00:45:42,447
It's not meant
as an honor.

631
00:46:13,779 --> 00:46:15,346
Bring me my goblet.

632
00:46:37,903 --> 00:46:40,271
What good is an empty cup?

633
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:42,807
Fill it.

634
00:46:57,523 --> 00:46:59,924
Kneel before your king.

635
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:06,297
Kneel.

636
00:47:12,605 --> 00:47:15,273
I said...

637
00:47:15,307 --> 00:47:17,175
kneel!

638
00:47:20,579 --> 00:47:22,146
Look, the pie.

639
00:47:36,695 --> 00:47:38,129
My queen.

640
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:52,076
Wonderful.

641
00:47:53,479 --> 00:47:56,347
Wonderful.

642
00:47:56,382 --> 00:47:58,249
<i>My hero.</i>

643
00:48:01,387 --> 00:48:04,522
- Can we leave now?
- Let's find out.

644
00:48:13,132 --> 00:48:14,365
Uncle.

645
00:48:17,803 --> 00:48:19,304
Where are you going?

646
00:48:19,338 --> 00:48:21,873
<i>You're my cupbearer,</i>
<i>remember?</i>

647
00:48:21,907 --> 00:48:24,475
I thought I might change
out of these wet clothes, Your Grace.

648
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:27,178
No, no, no.
No, you're perfect the way you are.

649
00:48:28,314 --> 00:48:30,581
Serve me my wine.

650
00:48:35,654 --> 00:48:38,556
Well, hurry up.
This pie is dry.

651
00:48:46,532 --> 00:48:48,366
Mm, good.

652
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,768
<i>Needs washing down.</i>

653
00:48:50,803 --> 00:48:53,338
If it please Your Grace,
Lady Sansa is very tired.

654
00:48:53,372 --> 00:48:56,107
<i>No.</i>

655
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:57,875
No, you'll wait here...

656
00:49:00,212 --> 00:49:03,448
<i>un--</i>

657
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:05,516
Your Grace?

658
00:49:07,286 --> 00:49:09,921
It's nothing.

659
00:49:15,461 --> 00:49:18,029
- He's choking!
- Help the poor boy.

660
00:49:21,633 --> 00:49:24,502
- Idiots, help your king.
- Move away!

661
00:49:26,572 --> 00:49:29,474
- Joffrey! Joffrey!
- Help him!

662
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:31,876
- Someone help him!
- Joffrey!

663
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:36,447
- Come with me now.
<i>- Joffrey! Joffrey!</i>

664
00:49:36,482 --> 00:49:38,683
If you want to live,
we have to leave.

665
00:49:38,717 --> 00:49:40,018
Don't touch him!

666
00:49:46,158 --> 00:49:48,059
Joffrey.

667
00:49:48,093 --> 00:49:50,561
Please, Joffrey.

668
00:49:50,596 --> 00:49:54,165
Joffrey, what is it?

669
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:56,634
Help him!

670
00:50:28,901 --> 00:50:31,369
My son.

671
00:50:37,042 --> 00:50:40,945
<i>He's gone.</i>
<i>Our king is gone.</i>

672
00:50:41,814 --> 00:50:43,181
He did this.

673
00:50:45,717 --> 00:50:48,920
He poisoned my son,

674
00:50:48,954 --> 00:50:50,621
your king.

675
00:50:50,656 --> 00:50:53,291
Take him.
Take him!

676
00:50:54,226 --> 00:50:56,027
Take him!

677
00:50:56,061 --> 00:50:58,196
Take him!
